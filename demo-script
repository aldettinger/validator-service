script:
cd "path to project"
mvn clean install
java -jar  java -jar target/rest-dsl-spring-boot-xstream-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Then launch a REST client (why not postman)
Set the HTTP method to "POST"
Set the url to "http://localhost:8080/camel/order/validation"
Set the raw content to:
{
  "customerId": "aldettinger",
  "products":
   [
   {
    "productId": "Water"
   }
   ]
}

You can then experiment other scenarios by sending the content of files located "src/test/resources/json-orders/*"
